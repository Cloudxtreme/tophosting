      plus a tons more that are not listed because of their quality. We take into account the factors mentioned in "How Top Hosting scores each host?".

      <h2>How Top Hosting scores each host?</h2>

      <p>
        Every hosting passes a regorous tests. There are four factors we take into account.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Speed</strong>, we test a web aplication with a high number of concurrency. We test the response time every 100x concurrent users.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Uptime</strong>, we have been monitoring every web application making requests every 30 seconds for each web application. Then we measure the uptime trough the month.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Features</strong>, each hosting offers additional and unique features that others do not have. These features are very important and are shown on the list.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Support</strong>, we like to be in trouble with our web application. We ask a lot. We take into account, response time, number of responses until a solution is found, and although this factor may be subjective, we also take into account kindness.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Price</strong>, this may be the most important factor. We update continuously the prices on the list. We search the best price currently available in all hostings.
